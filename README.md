# Youtube Music Downloader
**Purpose**

Using PyTube and FFMpy, this project aims to download music from YouTube videos into MP3 format.
PyTube serves the purpose to fetch the YouTube audio which defaults to MP4 fomrat. FFmpy will be used to convert to MP3 file format.

**Current Completion**

A command line interactive program is made to ask users for the link of the video. It will download the YouTube audio and 
the program will create a directory called "PyTube_Music" which will place all the downloaded music for the user.

**Future Goals**
1) Chrome Extension
   2) Users can go to a YouTube link and click the extension to download music
3) Loading Completion Bar 

New features planned in this project is to create a Chrome Extension that will make an API call to the backend server to 
download the YouTube audio. 
Users will need to click on the extension and it will download the video.

**Plan of Future**
